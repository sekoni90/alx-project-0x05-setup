# alx-project-0x05-setup
# Project Description
This project is a Next.js-based web application that allows users to generate AI-powered images by providing text prompts. The app interfaces with the GPT-4 Image Generation API to create unique images based on user input. The application features a clean UI with state management, custom hooks, and API integration, while following React best practices.

# Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

Understand and implement React state management using useState
Create and utilize custom React hooks
Work with environment variables for API key management
Implement API routes in Next.js applications
Develop reusable React components
Manage application state across multiple components
Implement responsive UI design with Tailwind CSS
Handle asynchronous operations in React
Follow React best practices for component structure and organization
Requirements
Node.js (v14 or later)
Next.js (v13 or later)
React (v18 or later)
# TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
GPT-4 API key (from RapidAPI)
Modern web browser
